# Project Mini sumo:
This project was a part of the robotics education at a [LSTME](https://www.lstme.sk/) summer camp 2025.
Children built their own robots and further customised them and coded it themselves.

## Specifications
Robot is 10x10cm playing at a standard mini sumo field.
Hardware parts are all 3D printed and can be found in "3D models" folder.
Software was coded in micropython in Thonny for a simple upload.
!!!make sure to use the NiMH rechargable batteries to not create and overvoltage on the rpi pico!!!

## Tasks
Each team had 3 tasks to make the robot do:
  1. Push an empty box 3-times out of the ring, while the box was purposefully placed such that it tested the search algorithms for blind spots
  2. Beat the "Dungeon Master"(organisers made robot with the code as seen in repo)
  3. Compete in a tournament(we managed to create a double elimination tournament of 8 teams)
